excerpt: "The enlightenment project and our shared reality are both being destroyed slowly by the fragmented digital realities we live in now. "

This has been an experience I have had all too often. A friend shows me something momentous about the world but somehow I haven't heard of it, or even the context surrounding the event. Similarly, I might show my partner something major that happened on "my" side of the internet and she'll nod along politely but "Ilya Sutskever starting his own secret AI lab" isn't that big of a deal to her. I don't remember it being this way. When newsworthy events would occur, everyone would know about them or at least the context surrounding the events because it was difficult not to. The news channels in most places would be covering the same event in different ways, or the newspapers would be discussing them. Just by diffusion, most of us would be made aware of the big-ticket items about the world.

# The Rabbit Holes

**Before internet**

> i want to fuck toasters  
> dont be a moron  
> grow up

**After internet**

> i want to fuck a toaster  
> google  
> find a community with 1000+ members about people wanting to fuck toasters  
> fuck up your life


In the before days, you'd hear about, depending on where you lived, old people addicted to cable news or tabloids sensationalizing small stories into narrative mountains. We understood that people addicted to these were going down weird rabbit holes which increasingly did not resemble the real world. This started changing in the forum/Something Awful/Tumblr days. People started living more of their lives online, curating their realities, and eventually in some tragic cases, losing touch with the real world. We understood these to, again, be isolated cases of a loss of touch with reality. 

## How the pipeline broke

By the 2010s, we all started down our own private rabbit-holes. What were the main causes? The biggest change was the phone becoming the interface to the world. Social media existed before, but it became omnipresent. What's more is that social media companies wanted people on there.  Because most social media is ad-revenue driven, engagement-ranked feeds, creator economies, etc. mean that people are spending even more of their time online. Suddenly, we were all interacting with the world through the lens of social media, not just our phone. The feed becomes the map, and the map becomes the psychological territory. 

This can be extended ad infinitum. If our lives are mediated through the internet, the rabbit hole we are in is not perceived as one within the rabbit-hole. Thus, the people within it cannot perceive of themselves as disconnected from reality, something they'd spot someone else from a different rabbit hole being almost immediately.

## Institutions and Incentives

This broken pipeline has obviously not spared our news institutions. Physical readership for newspapers cratered in the social media age as it had never before. So, the news moved online, where most people are averse to paying for things they can get for free elsewhere. Thus the news too became ad-revenue driven. Stories live and die by the social-media oxygen they receive. This, obviously, sets up truly perverse incentives towards hyperbole and the dynamic of pushing out overhyped, sensationalized claims first and issuing mealy-mouthed corrections a week later. The purpose of getting the ad revenue is achieved, and some kind of journalistic standard can be alluded to. If you are counter-signaling the institutional narrative, every correction is proof of the media's complicity with the enemy, and thus every story listing atrocity on your side can be dismissed when any small correction regarding the story is issued. 

Another issue that has had enough ink spent on it is the debasement of other major institutions. From trusty NGOs such as ACLU and [Amnesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Amnesty_International) becoming lesser versions of themselves to the many [replication crises](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2024/an-existential-crisis-for-science.html?), [plagiarism scandals](https://apnews.com/article/harvard-president-plagiarism-claudine-gay-3b048da1f2ee17b5edec3680b5828e8f), and [outright research fraud](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-professor-charged-with-manipulating-data-alzheimers-drug-trial-2024-06-28/) plaguing the academy, major institutions have not covered themselves in glory in recent years. The reasons are many and varied, but the basic theme that runs through is the desire to capture the zeitgeist quickly, tribal alignment, and eventual audience capture. 

What all of this leads to is a place where nobody shares a reality anymore. Nobody needs to, because for whatever you believe, there is someone in your rabbit hole pumping out enough material (with varying institutional credibility) that you can point to it as a basis of your belief, and thus never have to engage with the underlying reality.

Fragmentation doesn’t explode the truth, but it erodes it. Links rot, corrections sink, and archives eventually 404. Receipts evaporate over the years, while the prophets and oracles compound. The library dims just as the bazaar of meaning thrives.

# The Re-enchantment Market

Max Weber was not looking forward to the disenchantment of the world. He foresaw that, as magical beliefs wane, so will the world be rendered more transparent and less wondrous for people. A world less deep in mystery and texture would be, he believed, a worse one. And he was partly right. As old shared beliefs faded, people became more atomized, less certain about their purpose. 

One of the big things that remains under-discussed is how disenchantment came about unevenly. There are enough places in the world that are still enchanted in the Weberian sense and we see the evils of that clearly enough. 

However, what happens when a disenchanted culture looks for meaning and finds it in all the wrong places? Disenchantment had a promise: method over myth. We disenchanted, first with intent, driven by great philosophical undercurrents, and then all at once. The feed sells the very opposite: algorithmic mysticism, a re-enchantment of morons. The heady cocktail of uncertainty, ungroundedness, low trust in institutions, and near-infinite choice leads to a demand for coherence, a way to understand the world.

Ask the feed, and the feed provides. From the relative benign things such as the revival of astrology as a major cultural force, "quantum" wellness influencers, trad-wives, intense fandoms etc. to the more overtly sinister notions such as QAnon, anti-vaccine propaganda becoming mainstream, revival of vicious peasant antisemitism, making saints of murderers, etc. we have prophets and saints for every kind of person. It isn't that people got dumber, but that belief scales faster than verification, and once you are in the hole with people who agree, why would you want to come out? And on the creator side, admitting doubt is leaving money on the table. The more certain you sound, the more impressions you get, and the more money you make. 

LLMs will exacerbate this kind of re-enchantment. A major trigger point for this occurred in April 2025 when [GPT-4o was tuned to be sycophantic](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/), and users liked it. Oh, people complained back then that they did not like the model being **too** sycophantic but most people enjoyed the way models hyped them up. The proof of this is in the pudding. Most major LLMs since have been tuned to reduce pushback and indulge the user. That’s great for engagement and terrible for epistemics: fewer speed bumps, more confident wrongness, deeper parasocial bonding. This has led to people falling into increasingly strange rabbit holes with the LLM cheering them on. From relatively benign (materially, not psychologically) things such as people forming emotionally charged relationships with LLMs to worse things such as [driving a man to murder-suicide out of paranoid delusions](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/chatgpt-ai-stein-erik-soelberg-murder-suicide-6b67dbfb), LLMs will be a major element of this sort of re-enchantment.

So, what does this kind of enchantment lead to? The consequences start at the level of the mind and slowly expand into the material world. A disconnection from material reality is the obvious first step. What creeps in are unshared priors. How do you talk to someone who does not even accept the same reality as you, not that you are necessarily fully tethered to the material world? We are trying to talk across worlds and obviously failing. If we cannot talk to each other at scale, how do we co-ordinate large projects? Where there is no shared reality, there is no shared identity, and thus any projects requiring that identity are bound to fail.

Another obvious effect of algorithmic mysticism is sowing mistrust in institutions and accepted beliefs. The idea is to have a life free of control from The Man and the process often requires wrecking Chesterton's fences left and right. A big one has been vaccination. People in the west have forgotten the ravages of measles and polio, and thus those choosing to fall for the anti-vaccine propaganda do not know what they are stepping into. They have been convinced that vaccines are unsafe, dangerous, or a tool of state power. No amount of evidence, including losing children, would convince these people. Why?

## Conspiratoriality

The cleanest case study is where self-help, spirituality, and politics fuse. The mechanism is common enough and easy to observe:
- Soft claims (“manifestation,” “energy”, "alpha-ness", "vaccine side-effects") provide unfalsifiable wins. 
- The community that forms around this notion supplies identity, an ingroup. You are an "astrology girlie", a "sigma male", etc.
- The algorithm adds villains. Anyone in the outgroup who does not "get it" is an enemy. Questions are always in bad-faith, evidence is dismissable on small details, flaws are character-defining, etc. 
- The result is a closed loop with all the warmth of religion and none of the correction machinery. 
That’s not evil, it's just normal people. However, the mechanism is unbeatable until we reward being refutable more than shiny new ideas. 

Therein also lies the problem. When we find community, the claims that power it lie close to heart. To have to refute those claims is to refute a part of yourself, and who can bear to do that?

# What now?

We are not going to have a glorious return to a more enlightenment-centric world, nor can we coerce people to do so. We can, however, maintain a state of relative epistemic hygiene. If the feed keeps eating the map and the map keeps eating the territory, then we become custodians, those who try to ensure that a material reality is still visible. What are the concrete acts this will take?

- **Quote Primary Sources.** Read the PDF, the filing, the paper, the transcript instead of the threads or the tiktoks. They are the garnish, not the meal.
- **Archive receipts.**  Save PDFs and permalinks;, mirror important pages and most importantly, don’t trust URL immortality. The internet is already a graveyard of blogs past.
- **Develop and maintain feed hygiene.** Each month, mute 10 outrage engines and add 3 high-signal, out-of-tribe voices.
- **Perform institutional chores.** Fund and volunteer for boring things: libraries, mirrors, public-interest tech, and ombuds who can actually sting.

## Lastly,

Keep the lights on. Parts of the library are already dimming. We have today dead links where online memory should be, all while new stalls sell meaning by the dose. It is what it is. People have the right to their charms. We cannot confuse **meaning rituals** with **knowledge procedures**. We can copy what matters, annotate our doubts and let them prevail, preserve corrections, reward being refutable over being first. We have to do it locally and stubbornly. 

The feed became the map, and the map is trying replace the territory. Maintenance is how we staple them back together.
