This site is intended to showcase me as a systems engineer with experience across data platforms and applied ML. I build reliable ETL/lakehouse systems, productionize research code, and design algorithms when needed. Strong in distributed systems, ETL, computer vision and GPU programming. 

I am also wont to writing the occasional technical and non-technical blogpost, mostly about culture surrounding tech, society, and literature.

I will soon have a reading list up on the site so you can see my influences and things I enjoy reading.
